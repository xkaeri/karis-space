# Process
I've been wanting to make my own website for quite a while now, before I had it I used various carrds such as [carrd 1](https://kuninaru1.carrd.co/#) or also [carrd 2](kuninaru.carrd.co)<br/>
before I finally decided to create my own website where I can customize everything to my own choice without being bound by subscriptions and restrictions of not having some features. I however did not fully create this website alone, I had some help from Copilot who helped me often to resolve some errors in the code. If you have any questions feel free to ask them by sending me a message on discord: kuninaru


# How to get your own version of the website.
