                <p>
                    We strive for clear and consistent moderation, but also allow for flexibility to interpret rules based on their intended spirit, not just their exact wording. If we believe something abides by the spirit of a rule, we may allow it even if it would technically break a rule as written and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moderators have the discretion to issue warnings, mutes, and bans based on the severity and frequency of rule violations. Deliberately trying to manipulate the system by breaking rules will result in consequences.
